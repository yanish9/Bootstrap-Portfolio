SMS Körös was the first of the Körös-class river monitors built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and completed in 1892. As part of the Danube Flotilla during World War I, the ship fought various Allied forces from Belgrade down the Danube to the Black Sea. Renamed Morava after the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and remained in service throughout the interwar period, although not always in full commission. During the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Morava was the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division, operating on the Tisza river. The river monitor fought off attacks by the Luftwaffe and shot down one enemy aircraft, but was forced to withdraw to Belgrade. High river levels and low bridges made navigation difficult, and the ship was scuttled by the crew on 11 April. She was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state of Croatia and continued to serve as Bosna until striking a mine and sinking in June 1944. (Full article...)
